# new-idea
I have been using canvas for a while now and am providing some feedback
I feel that a more interactive profile page including, options to connect with others, easily share photos, or discuss, would allow for more interaction between users and overall more engagement.
Building off of this idea, I feel that a page consisting of all key information such as, all the course's home pages or syllabus links, would give students a better handle on where they stand in their course and what is required of them.
Finally, I have encountered a bug where the time does adjust itself on the calendar when switching time zones.
